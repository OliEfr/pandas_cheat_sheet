# pandas_cheat_sheet
The final cheat sheet you will ever need for pandas.

This cheat sheet is mostly based on the cheat sheet in the [official pandas repository](https://github.com/OliEfr/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pptx),
which itself is inpsired by the [RStudio Data Wrangling Cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf), written by Irv Lustig, [Princeton Consultants](https://www.princetonoptimization.com/)
